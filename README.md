# MagicSnippets

## Introduction
A magical place where all my crappy, throwaway scripts live.

## Scripts:
1. update-local-toolchain.sh - This does a git pull on all toolchain repositories in my local folder.
2. update-vim-packages.sh - This updates all my Vim packages (mostly under ~.vim/)
3. php-pbkdf2-test.php - A simple PHP script that encrypts plaintexts and decrypts ciphertexts based on PBKDF2 specification.
