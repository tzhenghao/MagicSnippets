# MagicSnippets

## Introduction
A magical place where all my crappy, throwaway scripts live.

## Scripts:
1. `update-local-toolchain.sh` - This does a git pull on all toolchain repositories in my local folder.
2. `update-vim-packages.sh` - This updates all my Vim packages (mostly under `~/.vim/`)
3. `php-pbkdf2-test.php` - A simple PHP script that encrypts plaintexts and decrypts
ciphertexts based on PBKDF2 specification.
4. `encrypt.sh + decrypt.sh` - Shell scripts that contain wrapper GPG commands for
encryption and decryption purposes.
5. `clean-up.sh` - Shell script that deletes my `bash` and `zsh` history.
